# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

### 02a. The Social Compact: Defining Needs, Standards, and Luxuries

To make the guarantee of well-being explicit and transparent, the city's economy and services are structured around three distinct, clearly defined categories. This framework forms the social compact between the city and its residents.

*   **Basic Needs:** This is a universal, static charter of goods and services guaranteed to every resident, under all circumstances. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Shelter:** A safe, private, climate-controlled MARS unit appropriate for the resident's household size.
    *   **Nutrition:** Access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets established dietary and medical needs.
    *   **Water & Sanitation:** Unrestricted access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
    *   **Healthcare:** Comprehensive preventative, emergency, and primary care, including mental and dental health services.
    *   **Security:** A safe environment protected by automated emergency and security services.
    *   **Energy & Connectivity:** Uninterrupted electricity, heating, and high-speed internet access.
    *   **Basic Education:** Foundational education and access to the city's complete knowledge base.
    
    The charter of Basic Needs can only be expanded and can never be reduced.

*   **Living Standard:** This is a dynamic and evolving set of goods and services provided to all residents, reflecting the city's technological progress and collective will. The line between the Living Standard and Luxuries is determined by a transparent, consensus-driven process, not by a simple majority or opaque algorithm.
    *   **Mechanism:** The Living Standard is defined by a "Living Standard Index" (LSI), a public list of specific goods and services.
    *   **Process for Evolution:** A product or service moves from a Luxury to the Living Standard when it meets clear, public criteria:
        1.  **Sustainability:** The city's automation can provide it to all residents without compromising the ecosystem or the provision of Basic Needs.
        2.  **Consensus:** A supermajority (e.g., >75%) of residents demonstrate a sustained preference for it through opt-in data over a defined period. This prevents fleeting trends from destabilizing the city's economy and ensures changes reflect a deep-seated community desire.
    *   **Transparency:** The current LSI and all proposals for its modification, along with their status against the required criteria, are publicly accessible in real-time.

*   **Luxuries:** Any product or service not included in Basic Needs or the current Living Standard. These are provided by a free market where residents can trade, innovate, and provide services to one another using a designated currency.

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
