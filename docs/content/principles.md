# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

## 06. The Utopian Standard of Provision (USP)

To give substance to our guarantees, the blueprint defines provisions in two tiers. Tier 1 is a universal constant for all Utopia cities, while Tier 2 is dynamic and reflects the collective preferences and productive capacity of a specific city.

### Tier 1: Universal Basic Needs
These are the non-negotiable foundations for a life of dignity, guaranteed to every resident. They are based on established global standards to ensure they are comprehensive.

*   **Nutrition:** Access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets dietary needs for an active and healthy life, consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines.
*   **Shelter (MARS):** A safe, private, and climate-controlled residential module as described in the Housing section, with access to clean water, sanitation, and waste management.
*   **Healthcare:** Comprehensive health services, from preventative care and treatment to rehabilitation and palliative care, aligned with the World Health Organization's principles of Universal Health Coverage. This includes primary care, emergency services, mental health support, and essential medicines.
*   **Information & Communication:** Unrestricted access to a high-speed, secure internet connection and the basic hardware required to interact with city systems and global information networks.
*   **Security:** A safe environment, protected by automated monitoring and emergency response systems, as well as the assurance of personal data privacy and security.
*   **Lifelong Education:** Access to foundational education and resources for continuous learning and skill development through the city's automated learning platforms.

### Tier 2: Community Living Standard
This tier includes goods and services that go beyond basic survival to enable a thriving community life. The scope of Tier 2 is dynamic, determined by the city's automation based on resident preference data, resource availability, and technological capability. Items in this tier are provided without charge but are subject to capacity.

*   **Examples may include:** Advanced public transportation networks, community centers, libraries, access to arts and cultural facilities, public parks and recreational spaces, and higher-level vocational training programs.

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
