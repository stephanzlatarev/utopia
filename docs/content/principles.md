# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

## 06. The Living Standard Charter

To ensure Principles 02, 03, and 04 are applied fairly and transparently, the city's operation is bound by a Living Standard Charter. This charter is a public, codified component of the blueprint that defines the quality and scope of all guaranteed needs and services.

### Core Tenets:
*   **Baseline Standard:** The minimum for all "basic needs" is grounded in internationally recognized standards for human dignity and well-being, such as the standards articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This provides a non-negotiable floor for quality of life.
*   **Dynamic Evolution:** The "living standard" is designed to evolve. The city's automation continuously monitors aggregate resident preference data and resource availability. When a product or service (previously considered a luxury) sees widespread, sustained demand and can be provided sustainably, the system will automatically propose its inclusion into the Living Standard Charter.
*   **Transparent Ratification:** Any proposed change to the Charter is made public to all residents for a review and feedback period. This process, managed by the automation, ensures that shifts in the living standard are transparent, predictable, and reflect a broad consensus, preventing arbitrary changes.
*   **Clear Market Boundary:** The Charter provides a clear and public definition of which goods and services are provided by the city. This creates a stable and predictable environment for the free market, which operates to provide luxuries beyond the scope of the current Charter.

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
