# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs are guaranteed. To ensure this principle is applied equitably and transparently, "basic needs" are defined within a comprehensive and evolving framework.

#### The Framework for Guaranteed Needs

The scope of guaranteed needs is not static. It is structured in tiers and is designed to evolve with the city's technological and productive capacity, ensuring the standard of living consistently improves.

*   **Tier 1: Foundational Needs:** These are the non-negotiable requisites for a dignified life, guaranteed to every resident from day one. This tier is guided by international standards such as Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It includes:
    *   **Sustenance:** Access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food and clean water.
    *   **Shelter:** Secure, private, and environmentally stable housing through the MARS system.
    *   **Healthcare:** Comprehensive physical and mental healthcare, from preventative care to emergency services.
    *   **Safety & Security:** A safe living environment protected from physical and digital threats.
    *   **Connectivity:** Unrestricted access to high-speed internet and communication tools.
    *   **Energy:** Uninterrupted access to clean and sustainable energy for household needs.

*   **Tier 2: Enabling Needs (The Living Standard):** These are needs essential for personal growth, community participation, and self-actualization. The services in this tier are determined by resident preferences and the city's capabilities. They represent the current "living standard" and may include:
    *   **Education:** Lifelong learning opportunities, from early childhood education to advanced skill development.
    *   **Mobility:** Free and accessible public transportation within the city.
    *   **Culture & Recreation:** Access to libraries, parks, community centers, and cultural events.
    *   **Social Connection:** Platforms and spaces designed to foster community and combat isolation.

#### Governance of the Framework

The definition and evolution of this framework are critical governance functions. While residents do not vote on individual policies, the process for updating the Tiers of Needs is transparent and participatory:
1.  **Continuous Assessment:** The city's automation continuously monitors resource availability, production capacity, and resident well-being metrics.
2.  **Community Proposals:** Residents can submit proposals for services to be re-categorized (e.g., moving a "luxury" to the "living standard") through the direct feedback system.
3.  **Periodic Review:** A dedicated, transparent process, managed by the blueprint's governance structure, reviews the framework at regular intervals. This review incorporates community proposals, expert analysis (from fields like public health, sociology, and ethics), and performance data from the city's automation.
4.  **Upward Ratchet:** In line with Principle 03, services can only be added to the guaranteed tiers or have their quality improved. A service, once guaranteed as a basic need or part of the living standard, cannot be removed.

This structured approach ensures that the promise of "all basic needs are guaranteed" is not an empty slogan, but a robust, evolving, and central feature of Utopia's design.

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
