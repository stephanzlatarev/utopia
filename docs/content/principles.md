# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.



### The Community Contribution Credit (CCC) System

To ensure the free market for luxuries is fair and accessible to all, and to prevent the emotional distress of economic inequality, Utopia utilizes the Community Contribution Credit (CCC) system. This digital currency is distinct from external state money and operates solely within the city's luxury economy.

*   **Universal Basic Credit (UBC):** Every resident receives a regular, unconditional allocation of CCCs. This ensures everyone can participate in the luxury market, alleviating feelings of exclusion and providing a baseline of economic freedom.
*   **Earned Credits:** Residents can voluntarily earn additional CCCs through activities that enrich the community. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **Creative Endeavors:** Producing art, music, or entertainment for public enjoyment.
    *   **Blueprint Innovation:** Submitting and developing successful improvements to the city blueprint.
    *   **Community Building:** Organizing social events, leading educational workshops, or mentoring others.
    *   **Ecological Stewardship:** Participating in projects that enhance the city's natural environment.
*   **Sense of Purpose:** This system provides a sense of purpose and recognition without reintroducing coercive labor. It transforms the pursuit of "luxury" from a purely material goal into a reward for positive social and creative engagement, reducing anxiety and fostering a collaborative spirit.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
