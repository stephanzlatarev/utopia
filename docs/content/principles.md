# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

## 06. The Principle of Evolution

To ensure Utopia remains a desirable and just society for all its residents across generations, the Founding Principles themselves must be able to evolve. This principle establishes a transparent and democratic process for amending the core tenets of the city.

An amendment to the Founding Principles can be enacted through the following process, which is managed by the city's automated administration to ensure fairness and transparency:

*   **Proposal:** An amendment can be proposed by a petition signed by at least 10% of the city's residents.
*   **Deliberation:** Upon reaching the proposal threshold, a city-wide deliberation period of six months is initiated. During this time, the automated systems will provide all residents with access to structured debates, expert analyses, and simulated impacts of the proposed change.
*   **Ratification:** Following the deliberation period, the proposed amendment is put to a city-wide referendum. The amendment is ratified only if it is approved by a supermajority of at least 75% of all residents.

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
