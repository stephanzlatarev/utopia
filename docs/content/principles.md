# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market


### 05a. Civic Contribution - The Engine of the Luxury Market

To power the free market for luxuries, Utopia implements a system of Civic Contribution Credits (CCC). This is a digital currency earned by residents through voluntary contributions that enhance the community, innovate on the blueprint, or create cultural value.

- **Earning Credits:** Residents earn CCCs by completing tasks or projects posted on a city-wide 'Contribution Marketplace'. These can range from artistic creation and scientific research to community organization and mentoring.
- **Community Valuation:** The value of a contribution, and thus the CCCs awarded, is determined by community-driven mechanisms, such as direct peer-to-peer appreciation or collective funding of proposed projects. This ensures that the luxury economy is aligned with the residents' shared values.
- **Fair Access:** This system provides every resident with an equal opportunity to participate in the luxury market, based on their passion and creativity rather than pre-existing capital. It provides the essential link between contribution and consumption in the non-essential part of the economy.

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
