# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

## 02. Charter of Basic Needs

The city is founded on the principle that all residents are entitled to a life of dignity, opportunity, and well-being. This is guaranteed through a Charter of Basic Needs, which serves as the foundational directive for the city's automation. This Charter is not a static list but a comprehensive framework that evolves in line with Principle 03.

### Framework and Scope

The scope of 'Basic Needs' is defined in accordance with internationally recognized principles of human rights and well-being, including those outlined in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Charter includes, but is not limited to, the following domains:

*   **Subsistence and Health:** Nutritious food and clean water; safe, adaptable, and private housing (as per the MARS design); universal physical and mental healthcare; sanitation; and a supply of clean energy.
*   **Safety and Security:** A safe living environment, protection from harm, and emergency response services.
*   **Education and Development:** Unrestricted access to information via a free and open internet; lifelong learning opportunities, from early childhood development to advanced skills training; and access to tools for creative and intellectual expression.
*   **Social and Community Well-being:** Access to public spaces, recreational facilities, and community centers that foster social connection and belonging.
*   **Environmental Health:** A clean, unpolluted environment, including clean air and access to natural green spaces.

This Charter forms the baseline for the city's provisioning systems. Any good or service covered by this Charter will never require payment and its quality will be maintained or improved over time.

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
