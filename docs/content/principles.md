# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

### 05a. Civic Contribution Credits - The Engine of the Luxury Market

To provide a clear, fair, and structured process for the luxury market described in Principle 05, the Utopia economic system incorporates Civic Contribution Credits (CCC).

*   **Earning Credits:** Residents earn CCC by contributing to the community through activities defined as 'civil work'. This can include mentoring, creating public art, developing open-source blueprint modules, organizing community events, or engaging in advanced research. The value of these contributions is assessed by an automated system that analyzes community demand, project complexity, and overall impact, ensuring a fair and transparent earning process.
*   **Medium of Exchange:** CCC is the sole medium of exchange for all goods and services classified as 'luxury'. It is a non-transferable digital credit recorded on a secure, transparent ledger, meaning credits cannot be gifted, inherited, or accumulated through speculation. This design ensures that access to luxury is directly tied to an individual's recent and ongoing contributions, not to accumulated wealth.
*   **Market Dynamics:** This system creates a vibrant and purposeful luxury market. Entrepreneurs and creators can offer luxury goods (e.g., bespoke furniture, artisanal foods) or services (e.g., personalized coaching, entertainment experiences) in exchange for CCC, which they can then use to acquire luxuries for themselves. This fosters innovation and personal expression without reintroducing the systemic risks of traditional monetary systems.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
