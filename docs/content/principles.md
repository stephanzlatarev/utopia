# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people makes decisions for the rest. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resourt where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, we jointly decide what needs beyonds the guaranteed basic needs we set as the living standard and the city provides for them through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the decisions of the citizens, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the choices of their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.

## 06. Dynamic & Verifiable Governance

The city's automation is governed by a digital charterâ€”a living set of rules established and amended by its citizens. While no single person or group holds executive power, collective decision-making is enabled through a transparent, three-tiered protocol, ensuring both stability and adaptability.

- **Core Constitution**: Foundational principles (e.g., guaranteeing basic needs, protecting rights) that are part of the city's core code. Amendments require a supermajority consensus (e.g., >75% of all residents) and a mandatory cooling-off period to prevent reactionary changes.

- **Living Standard Legislation**: Policies regarding the city-wide living standard (e.g., upgrading public transport, increasing food variety) are proposed by any citizen via a public platform. They are debated, refined, and voted upon quarterly. Decisions are enacted by a simple majority and implemented into the automation's operational parameters.

- **Dispute & Anomaly Resolution**: An independent, elected Citizen Oversight Council serves a judicial function. They do not create rules but are empowered to interpret the charter in edge cases, resolve conflicts between automated systems, and audit the AI for fairness and compliance. This provides a crucial human-in-the-loop for situations requiring nuanced judgment.
