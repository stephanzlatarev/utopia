# Founding principles

## 01. Automation - Everything is automated

All aspects of the city are automated. The city does not rely on human labor and it creates an economy that does not exploit human labor.

> The belief behind this principle is that people have greater purpose and therefore our future economy should not be powered by human labor.

## 02. Fairness - No person controls the city

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people has power over the city or its residents. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

> The belief behind this principle is that people cannot be truly fair to all and therefore our future politics should not be controlled by elites.

## 03. Needs - All human basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resort where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, healthcare, internet, are guaranteed.

> The belief behind this principle is that our society can take care for all and therefore no person should need to live in survival mode.

## 04. Standard - Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, our preferences determine what needs beyond the guaranteed basic needs are set as the living standard. The city provides for the standard of living through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 05. Luxury - Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 06. Freedom - People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated and new Utopia cities can be found. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the preferences of the residents, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the conditions in their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.


## 07. Deliberation - The Process for Defining Needs, Standard, and Luxury

To ensure fairness and transparency in how the city evolves, the classification of goods and services into the categories of Basic Needs, Living Standard, and Luxury follows a clear, participatory, and data-driven process. This principle gives residents a direct role in shaping the city's social contract, ensuring the line between guaranteed services and market goods is not arbitrary but a reflection of collective values and technological capacity.

> The belief behind this principle is that the definition of a 'good life' evolves. Therefore, the process for defining it must be transparent, democratic, and adaptable, preventing hidden algorithms or elite groups from dictating the social standard.

### The Classification Framework

*   **Basic Needs:** This category is foundational and stable, encompassing the physiological and safety requirements outlined in this blueprint (shelter, food, healthcare, etc.). Changes to this core list require a supermajority consensus through the deliberation process.
*   **Living Standard:** This category includes goods and services that are widely considered essential for comfortable and meaningful participation in Utopian society. This list is dynamic and is the primary subject of the deliberation process.
*   **Luxury:** This category includes all other goods and services offered on the free market. Luxuries that see widespread adoption and are deemed essential by the community are candidates for becoming part of the Living Standard.

### The Deliberation Cycle

The city's administration automation facilitates a regular, semi-annual Deliberation Cycle to review and potentially reclassify goods and services.

1.  **Nomination Phase:** Any resident or group of residents can nominate a 'Luxury' item for consideration to be included in the 'Living Standard'. Nominations must be accompanied by a rationale addressing its potential impact on community well-being, resource sustainability, and equity.
2.  **Analysis Phase:** The city's automation provides a transparent, public impact analysis for each nomination. This includes:
    *   **Resource Cost Analysis:** The material, energy, and maintenance cost to provide the service to all residents.
    *   **Adoption Metrics:** Data on the current usage and demand for the service within the luxury market.
    *   **Equity Simulation:** Models showing the potential effects on social equity and accessibility.
3.  **Deliberation Phase:** Residents engage in structured discussions, both digitally and in community spaces. AI-powered tools summarize arguments, identify points of consensus and disagreement, and ensure all perspectives are heard. This phase is for developing a shared understanding, not just voting.
4.  **Consensus Phase:** A formal consensus-seeking process is initiated. The automation determines the level of community consensus based on direct feedback. A service is moved from 'Luxury' to 'Standard' if it passes a pre-defined high threshold of support (e.g., 75% consensus), ensuring that changes to the standard of living reflect a strong majority will and are sustainable.
