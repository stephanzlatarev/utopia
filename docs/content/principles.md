# Founding principles

## 01. No person controls the city

### 01.1 Automated Participatory Governance

While no single person or group controls the city, decisions regarding living standards and evolving city rules (as described in Principle 03) are made through a robust, transparent, and auditable decentralized consensus protocol. Every resident's validated input is processed by the city's core automation, which then updates operational parameters and resource allocation based on aggregated, cryptographically secured outcomes. This system ensures genuine democratic participation without human intermediaries in the execution of governance.

*   **Mechanism**: A secure, blockchain-based voting and proposal system where residents submit and vote on policy adjustments or enhancements to the living standard. This system could leverage concepts from Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) adapted for physical infrastructure governance. (Source: Antonopoulos, A. M. (2014).

*   **Execution**: Approved proposals are directly translated into updated parameters and code for the city's AI and automation systems, ensuring direct implementation without human intervention in the execution phase.
*   **Auditability**: All proposals, votes, and their subsequent implementation logs are publicly auditable and immutably recorded, fostering transparency and trust in the governance process.

The city is run by automation based on rules. No person or group of people makes decisions for the rest. Thus no one can abuse their power and use public resources for private interest. This is how corruption cannot exist in the city.

## 02. All basic needs are guaranteed

The city runs as an all-inclusive resourt where all basic needs, like shelter, security, heating, electricity, water, food, internet, are guaranteed.

## 03. Standard of living improves only

Progress, innovation, and increasing productivity mean that what we can produce today, we can also produce tomorrow with less effort and resources. In our city, we jointly decide what needs beyonds the guaranteed basic needs we set as the living standard and the city provides for them through automation with stable or increasing quality.

## 04. Luxuries come from the free market

Any product or service beyond the basic needs and the living standard is considered luxury. These are provided by the free market. Money is used only for luxury items. Money is not necessary for the products and services of the basic needs and living standard. Thus the market doesn't require regulation outside ensuring basic needs, such as safety.

## 05. People have the freedom over their citizenship

The blueprint of Utopia cities is public and freely available. It ensures it can be easily replicated. As all Utopia cities guarantee the basic needs of their citizens but living standards may differ based on the decisions of the citizens, people are free to move or found another city when they don't accept the choices of their previous city. Thus, nobody can be forced to live in unacceptable conditions against their will.
