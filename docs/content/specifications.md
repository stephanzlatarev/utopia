    * Limiting factor - Not identified yet
    * Constraints - the "human-scale area" factor
    * Considerations - See "20-minute neighborhood" or "walkable neighborhood" concept in urban planning research.

## Energy

The blueprint relies on reliable and sustainable energy technologies that do not pollute the environment.
Geothermal energy is selected as the standard energy source because it is readily available everywhere, it's reliable, doesn't pollute.

The city uses 5 km deep closed-loop geothermal systems (Advanced Geothermal Systems) for zero emissions.
The energy is used for heating and electricity. Load balancing is fully automated in real-time based on current and predicted demand.

Several separate AGS ensure redundancy. The energy grid is with automatic fault detection and self-healing capabilities.

- **Generation**: 1 TWh annually (based on 100 MWh per resident)
- **Cost**: $65,000,000 annually (based on $65 per MWh)

The design does not require survace space or battery storage.

Alternatives on our technology radar are:
* Nuclear fission - This existing technology needs to minimize pollution, ensure access to source materials, and maximize safety before it is selected for the blueprint.
* Nuclear fusion - This future technology needs to be developed before it is selected for the blueprint.
* Space-based solar power - This future technology needs to be developed and safety concerns addressed before it is selected for the blueprint.
