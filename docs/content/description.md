# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

In order to ensure that the city reflects the needs and preferences of its residents without possibility for corruption of a ruling elite, governance powers are segregated between three aspects.

### City administration

The city is governed by automated rules that are provided with the blueprint. In the early stages of the implementation of an Utopia city, e.g. Class U1, people will be heavily involved in supervising and carrying out administrative tasks of governance over the city. They may find ways to exploit weaknesses of the blueprint to concentrate power and act in corrupt ways until the developers of the blueprint identify and mitigate those weaknesses. In later stages, Class U5, when city administration is fully automated the possibilities for corruption within the city will be fully removed.

Citizens do not vote on policies, laws and rules. However, they can influence the administration and development of their city in a few ways:
- through their preferences - This mechanism is encoded in the blueprint of the city. As part of the automation, the city administration will collect information about preferences by the residents, through monitoring of usage of services and direct feedback, and will activate the configurations and automations of the blueprint that best reflect the preferences of the residents.
- through direct feedback - The city keeps its blueprint and current state readily available to all its residents, similar to how the public transport in modern sity shows the lines and schedules in realtime. Residents can look into the details of how the city operates in any aspect and any level they want through personal smart devices, public interactive screens, or even AI guide tour. This system doubles as a portal to raise incidents, issues, ideas for improvements - all automatically directed to the developers of the blueprint.
- through civil work - Although the city is fully automated and does not rely on human labor, residents are encouraged to put their mind, energy, and creativity in help of the community. They can work alongside the automation. In lower class cities, they could perform non-automated tasks, train the automation, or supervise it. In higher class cities, they can develop and practice their skills lead by the AI of the automation.
- through blueprint development - Residents may be interested in becoming developers of the blueprint. Then, they will influence all Utopia cities, not just theirs.

The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

### Blueprint development

The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. Collectively, the developers of the blueprint have no stake in any individual Utopia city. The open source nature of the blueprint allows for parallel variants which removes the possibility for the developers to encode concentrated power of an elite group in all Utopia cities.
This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.

This design choice is inspired by the Linux operating system for computers. The developers of Linux distributions encode automation rules for how the computer resources are used for certain tasks. Yet, they don't have any control over the computers on which I install the Linux OS.

### State rule

Until the automation advances sufficiently, the city operates within a state.
The benefit is that the state laws and policies will cover the dynamics that the blueprint and its automation is not ready for. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.

The downside is that the city can isolate its residents from state corruption only to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. The most mature future stages of Utopia cities, Class 6, will have sufficiently advanced automation to handle nuanced resolution of disputes and conflicts fairly and without human bias.

## Housing

## Cultural & Arts Programs

To ensure Utopia is a center for human creativity and not just automated efficiency, a structured framework is established to support cultural and artistic expression as part of the city's standard of living. This framework operates on a two-tiered process, balancing foundational support with dynamic, community-driven initiatives.

### Tier 1: Foundational Cultural Infrastructure

The city's automation guarantees access to a baseline of cultural resources for all residents. This is managed as part of the standard of living and includes:
*   **Public Creation Spaces:** Fully-equipped workshops (makerspaces), art studios, music rehearsal rooms, and digital media labs accessible to all residents.
*   **Performance Venues:** A network of modular, multi-purpose venues for theater, concerts, and gatherings, with scheduling and technical support managed by the city automation.
*   **Resource Libraries:** Both physical and digital libraries providing access to artistic materials, tools, historical archives, and educational content.

### Tier 2: Dynamic Cultural Initiatives

Building upon the foundational infrastructure, this tier provides a process for residents to propose, gain support for, and execute specific cultural projects. The process is managed through the city's central feedback and administration portal.

1.  **Proposal Submission:** Any resident or group can submit a proposal for a cultural project (e.g., a public mural, a music festival, a community play, a lecture series) via the city portal. The proposal must outline the project's vision, required resources (space, materials, automation assistance), and intended community impact.
2.  **Community Review & Support:** Proposals are made public on the portal. Residents can review, comment, and pledge their support or participation. This phase functions as a transparent measure of community interest, directly feeding into the city's 'preferences' data.
3.  **Automated Feasibility Analysis:** The city's administration AI performs an automated analysis of the proposal against available resources, logistical constraints, and safety protocols.
4.  **Resource Allocation:** Projects that demonstrate sufficient community support and pass the feasibility analysis are approved. The automation then allocates the necessary resources, schedules venue access, and coordinates logistical support, treating the project as a temporary addition to the city's standard of living services.

To fulfill the principle of guaranteed shelter, Utopia implements a Modular and Adaptable Residential System (MARS). This system is designed to provide housing that dynamically meets the varied and changing needs of its residents.

### Key Features:
*   **Modularity:** Residential buildings are constructed from standardized, prefabricated modules (e.g., living space modules, kitchen modules, accessible bathroom modules).
*   **Adaptability:** Based on declared resident preferences and needs (such as family growth, aging, or disability), the automation system can reconfigure, add, or remove modules from a residential unit. This ensures a resident's home evolves with their life-cycle.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of standardized modules allows for automated mass production, high energy efficiency standards, and simplified robotic maintenance. It also creates a circular economy where modules from downsized or vacated units are refurbished and redeployed, minimizing waste.
*   **Allocation:** Initial housing allocation and subsequent modifications are managed by the city's core automation, based on resident profiles and needs assessment, ensuring equitable and appropriate distribution of living space.
