# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

In order to ensure that the city reflects the needs and preferences of its residents without possibility for corruption of a ruling elite, governance powers are segregated between three aspects.

### City administration

The city is governed by automated rules that are provided with the blueprint. In the early stages of the implementation of an Utopia city, e.g. Class U1, people will be heavily involved in supervising and carrying out administrative tasks of governance over the city. They may find ways to exploit weaknesses of the blueprint to concentrate power and act in corrupt ways until the developers of the blueprint identify and mitigate those weaknesses. In later stages, Class U5, when city administration is fully automated the possibilities for corruption within the city will be fully removed.

Citizens do not vote on policies, laws and rules. However, they can influence the administration and development of their city in a few ways:
- through their preferences - This mechanism is encoded in the blueprint of the city. As part of the automation, the city administration will collect information about preferences by the residents, through monitoring of usage of services and direct feedback, and will activate the configurations and automations of the blueprint that best reflect the preferences of the residents.
- through direct feedback - The city keeps its blueprint and current state readily available to all its residents, similar to how the public transport in modern sity shows the lines and schedules in realtime. Residents can look into the details of how the city operates in any aspect and any level they want through personal smart devices, public interactive screens, or even AI guide tour. This system doubles as a portal to raise incidents, issues, ideas for improvements - all automatically directed to the developers of the blueprint.
- through civil work - Although the city is fully automated and does not rely on human labor, residents are encouraged to put their mind, energy, and creativity in help of the community. They can work alongside the automation. In lower class cities, they could perform non-automated tasks, train the automation, or supervise it. In higher class cities, they can develop and practice their skills lead by the AI of the automation.
- through blueprint development - Residents may be interested in becoming developers of the blueprint. Then, they will influence all Utopia cities, not just theirs.

The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

### Blueprint development

The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. Collectively, the developers of the blueprint have no stake in any individual Utopia city. The open source nature of the blueprint allows for parallel variants which removes the possibility for the developers to encode concentrated power of an elite group in all Utopia cities.
This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.

This design choice is inspired by the Linux operating system for computers. The developers of Linux distributions encode automation rules for how the computer resources are used for certain tasks. Yet, they don't have any control over the computers on which I install the Linux OS.

### State rule

### Public Safety and Emergency Response

To fulfill the principle of guaranteed security, Utopia integrates a hybrid human-AI emergency response system designed for rapid, effective, and scalable crisis management. This system ensures resident safety from fire, medical, and environmental emergencies, and it evolves in its human-AI composition across city classes.

*   **Tier 1: Automated Detection and Initial Response:** The city's infrastructure is embedded with a network of advanced sensors that monitor for fire, structural failures, bio-anomalies, and medical distress signals from personal devices. Upon detection, the automation immediately dispatches autonomous units—such as fire-suppression drones, robotic first-aiders, or containment units—to the scene for immediate assessment and mitigation. This drastically reduces response times, which is the most critical factor in saving lives.

*   **Tier 2: Specialized Human Command:** For complex incidents requiring advanced strategic thinking, ethical judgment, and empathy, the city employs a corps of highly-trained, professional human Emergency Response Officers (EROs). EROs are not a political class but a professional service. They command the automated units from mobile or central command centers, interpreting complex data provided by the AI and making critical decisions that go beyond pre-programmed protocols.

*   **Tier 3: Citizen-Assisted Resilience:** The city promotes a culture of community resilience by offering voluntary certification programs in first aid, disaster preparedness, and emergency assistance. In a large-scale crisis, the city's network can notify and coordinate these certified volunteers to assist in low-risk support roles, fostering community cohesion and augmenting the official response.

This tiered system is designed to evolve. In early-stage cities (Class U1-U3), the system relies more heavily on human EROs. In later stages (Class U5+), the balance shifts towards more sophisticated and autonomous Tier 1 and Tier 2 AI capabilities, with humans taking on highly specialized oversight and strategic command roles.

Until the automation advances sufficiently, the city operates within a state.
The benefit is that the state laws and policies will cover the dynamics that the blueprint and its automation is not ready for. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.

The downside is that the city can isolate its residents from state corruption only to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. The most mature future stages of Utopia cities, Class 6, will have sufficiently advanced automation to handle nuanced resolution of disputes and conflicts fairly and without human bias.

## Housing

To fulfill the principle of guaranteed shelter, Utopia implements a Modular and Adaptable Residential System (MARS). This system is designed to provide housing that dynamically meets the varied and changing needs of its residents.

### Key Features:
*   **Modularity:** Residential buildings are constructed from standardized, prefabricated modules (e.g., living space modules, kitchen modules, accessible bathroom modules).
*   **Adaptability:** Based on declared resident preferences and needs (such as family growth, aging, or disability), the automation system can reconfigure, add, or remove modules from a residential unit. This ensures a resident's home evolves with their life-cycle.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of standardized modules allows for automated mass production, high energy efficiency standards, and simplified robotic maintenance. It also creates a circular economy where modules from downsized or vacated units are refurbished and redeployed, minimizing waste.
*   **Allocation:** Initial housing allocation and subsequent modifications are managed by the city's core automation, based on resident profiles and needs assessment, ensuring equitable and appropriate distribution of living space.
