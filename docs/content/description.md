# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

### Open-Source Governance Framework

The "blueprint of the automation" is not merely public; its evolution is managed through a transparent, decentralized, and auditable open-source governance framework designed to prevent any single person or group from asserting control. This framework, drawing inspiration from principles of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), operates as follows:

1.  **Public Code Repository:** All source code, configuration files, and documentation for the city's automation are hosted in a publicly accessible and auditable version-controlled repository (e.g., inspired by Git). This ensures full transparency and allows for independent scrutiny.
2.  **Proposal & Review Process:** Any resident or qualified contributor can propose changes, improvements, or bug fixes through formal "Governance Proposals" submitted to the repository. These proposals undergo automated checks and community peer review, encouraging broad participation and identifying potential issues.
3.  **Decentralized Consensus & Approval:** Significant changes to core automated rules or principles are approved through a decentralized consensus mechanism, potentially involving a weighted preference system where validated citizen preferences (historical data, active surveys, simulated impact assessments) or reputation-based contributions influence the outcome. This ensures decisions reflect the collective will and values of the residents, not a centralized authority.
4.  **Automated Deployment:** Once a proposal achieves the required consensus, its implementation is triggered by automated deployment pipelines, removing the need for human intervention in the final execution phase. These deployments often include time-locks or multi-signature safeguards to prevent rapid, unreviewed alterations.
5.  **Auditing & Accountability:** Every change, decision, and deployment within the governance framework is recorded and publicly auditable, providing a full ledger of the city's operational evolution. Mechanisms for challenging automated decisions based on this audit trail are also defined, ensuring continuous accountability.

This framework ensures that while the city runs on automated rules, the evolution of those rules is a transparent, collaborative, and decentralized process, upholding the principle that "no person or group of people have power over the city."

The city is governed by automated rules.
The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.
The citizens do not vote but they influence the administration and development of their city through their preferrences.
The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

The city operates within a state. It can isolate its residents from state corruption to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.
