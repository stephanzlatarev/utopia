# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

In order to ensure that the city reflects the needs and preferences of its residents without possibility for corruption of a ruling elite, governance powers are segregated between three aspects.

### City administration

The city is governed by automated rules that are provided with the blueprint. In the early stages of the implementation of an Utopia city, e.g. Class U1, people will be heavily involved in supervising and carrying out administrative tasks of governance over the city. They may find ways to exploit weaknesses of the blueprint to concentrate power and act in corrupt ways until the developers of the blueprint identify and mitigate those weaknesses. In later stages, Class U5, when city administration is fully automated the possibilities for corruption within the city will be fully removed.

Citizens do not vote on policies, laws and rules. However, they influence the administration and development of their city through their preferrences. This is encoded in the blueprint of the city. As part of the automation, the city administration will collect information about preferences by the residents, through monitoring of usage of services and direct feedback, and will activate the configurations and automations of the blueprint that best reflect the preferences of the residents.

The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

### Blueprint development

The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. Collectively, the developers of the blueprint have no stake in any individual Utopia city. The open source nature of the blueprint allows for parallel variants which removes the possibility for the developers to encode concentrated power of an elite group in all Utopia cities.
This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.

This design choice is inspired by the Linux operating system for computers. The developers of Linux distributions encode automation rules for how the computer resources are used for certain tasks. Yet, they don't have any control over the computers on which I install the Linux OS.

### State rule

Until the automation advances sufficiently, the city operates within a state.
The benefit is that the state laws and policies will cover the dynamics that the blueprint and its automation is not ready for. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.

The downside is that the city can isolate its residents from state corruption only to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. The most mature future stages of Utopia cities, Class 6, will have sufficiently advanced automation to handle nuanced resolution of disputes and conflicts fairly and without human bias.

## Housing


## Waste Management

To uphold the principles of sustainability and an ever-improving standard of living, Utopia integrates a closed-loop Waste-to-Resource (WTR) system. This ensures that the byproducts of consumption do not become a burden but are instead repurposed as assets for the city.

### Key Features:
*   **Automated Collection:** A city-wide network of subterranean pneumatic tubes transports waste directly from residential, commercial, and public disposal points to a central processing facility. This eliminates the need for collection vehicles, reducing noise, traffic, and emissions.
*   **Intelligent Sorting:** At the central facility, a combination of AI-driven optical scanners, robotics, and advanced sensors sorts the mixed waste streams with high precision. This separates organics, various types of plastics, metals, glass, and other materials for optimal processing.
*   **Resource Recovery:** Sorted materials are channeled into dedicated recovery streams. Organics undergo anaerobic digestion to produce biogas for energy and nutrient-rich soil supplements. Recyclables are processed into raw materials for use in the city's automated manufacturing. Non-recyclable, non-hazardous materials are processed through plasma gasification to generate clean energy (syngas) and inert, reusable construction aggregate.
*   **Luxury Market Integration:** The system is designed to identify and safely handle the diverse and unpredictable waste generated by the free market. Special disposal points for e-waste and hazardous materials ensure they are properly neutralized and their valuable components are recovered, preventing environmental contamination and system failure.

To fulfill the principle of guaranteed shelter, Utopia implements a Modular and Adaptable Residential System (MARS). This system is designed to provide housing that dynamically meets the varied and changing needs of its residents.

### Key Features:
*   **Modularity:** Residential buildings are constructed from standardized, prefabricated modules (e.g., living space modules, kitchen modules, accessible bathroom modules).
*   **Adaptability:** Based on declared resident preferences and needs (such as family growth, aging, or disability), the automation system can reconfigure, add, or remove modules from a residential unit. This ensures a resident's home evolves with their life-cycle.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of standardized modules allows for automated mass production, high energy efficiency standards, and simplified robotic maintenance. It also creates a circular economy where modules from downsized or vacated units are refurbished and redeployed, minimizing waste.
*   **Allocation:** Initial housing allocation and subsequent modifications are managed by the city's core automation, based on resident profiles and needs assessment, ensuring equitable and appropriate distribution of living space.
