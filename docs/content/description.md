# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.
They guarnatee the basic human needs and provide for a standard of living beyond that.

## Governance

In order to ensure that the city reflects the needs and preferences of its residents without possibility for corruption of a ruling elite, governance powers are segregated between three aspects - city administration, blueprint development, and state rule.

### City administration

The city is governed by automated rules that are provided with the blueprint.

> In the early stages of the implementation of an Utopia city, e.g. Class U1, people will be heavily involved in supervising and carrying out administrative tasks of governance over the city. They may find ways to exploit weaknesses of the blueprint to concentrate power and act in corrupt ways until the developers of the blueprint identify and mitigate those weaknesses. In later stages, Class U5, when city administration is fully automated the possibilities for corruption within the city will be fully removed.

Citizens do not vote on policies, laws and rules. However, they can influence the administration and development of their city in a few ways:
- through their preferences - This mechanism is encoded in the blueprint of the city. As part of the automation, the city administration will collect information about preferences by the residents, through monitoring of usage of services and direct feedback, and will activate the configurations and automations of the blueprint that best reflect the preferences of the residents.
- through direct feedback - The city keeps its blueprint and current state readily available to all its residents, similar to how the public transport in modern sity shows the lines and schedules in realtime. Residents can look into the details of how the city operates in any aspect and any level they want through personal smart devices, public interactive screens, or even AI guide tour. This system doubles as a portal to raise incidents, issues, ideas for improvements - all automatically directed to the developers of the blueprint.
- through civil work - Although the city is fully automated and does not rely on human labor, residents are encouraged to put their mind, energy, and creativity in help of the community. They can work alongside the automation. In starting-class cities, they could perform non-automated tasks, train the automation, or supervise it. In higher class cities, they can develop and practice their skills lead by the AI of the automation.
- through blueprint development - Residents may be interested in becoming developers of the blueprint. Then, they will influence all Utopia cities, not just theirs.

The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

### Blueprint development

### Justice and Conflict Resolution

To ensure social harmony and uphold the principle of personal security, Utopia implements a multi-tiered system for resolving disputes and addressing blueprint violations. This framework is designed to be restorative rather than punitive, focusing on repairing harm and strengthening community bonds. It replaces the undefined dependency on external 'state rule' with a clear internal process that evolves with the city's class.

#### Tier 1: Automated Assistance & Mediation
For minor, non-malicious conflicts (e.g., disputes over shared space usage, noise complaints), residents can access an AI-driven assistance tool. This system acts as an impartial digital mediator that:
-   Clarifies the relevant blueprint rules and guidelines.
-   Analyzes data (with consent) to identify patterns and suggest compromises.
-   Facilitates anonymous or moderated communication between parties to find a mutually agreeable solution.

#### Tier 2: Community-Led Restorative Circles
If automated assistance is insufficient or inappropriate, the issue can be escalated to a voluntary, human-led process. This is managed by the Community Justice Council (CJC), a body of residents who have undergone certified training in mediation and restorative justice (a form of advanced 'civil work'). The process involves:
-   **Mediation:** A neutral third party from the CJC facilitates a conversation to help disputing parties reach an agreement.
-   **Restorative Circles:** For incidents involving harm, the CJC convenes a circle including those who were harmed, those who caused harm, and affected community members. The goal is to acknowledge the harm, understand the impact, and collectively decide on a path to repair the harm and reintegrate individuals into the community.

#### Tier 3: Formal Adjudication & Host State Integration
For serious blueprint violations (e.g., acts causing significant physical or psychological harm) or when restorative processes are rejected or fail, a formal process is required.
-   **In Class U1-U5 Cities:** These incidents are formally referred to the legal and judicial system of the host state in which the city operates. The city administration's role is to cooperate fully with state authorities while providing support services (e.g., counseling, temporary re-housing) to affected residents.
-   **In Class U6+ Cities:** As a city becomes independent of a host state, its CJC will evolve to include a formal adjudication branch. This branch will operate based on a constitutional framework developed as part of the blueprint, ensuring due process, rights of the accused, and transparent proceedings. The focus remains restorative, but with the authority to enact binding resolutions, including temporary or permanent removal from the city in extreme cases, upholding Principle 05.

The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. Collectively, the developers of the blueprint have no stake in any individual Utopia city. The open source nature of the blueprint allows for parallel variants which removes the possibility for the developers to encode concentrated power of an elite group in all Utopia cities.
This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.

This design choice is inspired by the Linux operating system for computers. The developers of Linux distributions encode automation rules for how the computer resources are used for certain tasks. Yet, they don't have any control over the computers on which I install the Linux OS.

### State rule

Until the automation advances sufficiently, the city operates within a state.
The benefit is that the state laws and policies will cover the dynamics that the blueprint and its automation is not ready for. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.

The downside is that the city can isolate its residents from state corruption only to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. The most mature future stages of Utopia cities, Class 6, will have sufficiently advanced automation to handle nuanced resolution of disputes and conflicts fairly and without human bias.

> Starting-class Utopia cities are very dependent on the states in which they operate. In essence, they operate as a hotel with its rules governing a guest's stay, while the guest is still subject to the state laws governing their citizen's life.
> Mature-class cities will have advanced automation that will make them independent of any state.

## Spaces

Utopia city has different spaces - personal spaces, group spaces, and public spaces.

Utopia implements a Modular and Adaptable Residential System (MARS) to provide housing, community, and office spaces that dynamically meet the varied and changing needs of its residents.

#### Key Features:
*   **Modularity:** Residential buildings are constructed from standardized, prefabricated modules (e.g., living space modules, kitchen modules, accessible bathroom modules).
*   **Adaptability:** Based on declared resident preferences and needs (such as family growth, aging, or disability), the automation system can reconfigure, add, or remove modules from a residential unit. This ensures a resident's home evolves with their life-cycle.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of standardized modules allows for automated mass production, high energy efficiency standards, and simplified robotic maintenance. It also creates a circular economy where modules from downsized or vacated units are refurbished and redeployed, minimizing waste.
*   **Allocation:** Initial housing allocation and subsequent modifications are managed by the city's core automation, based on resident profiles and needs assessment, ensuring equitable and appropriate distribution of living space.

## Basic needs

The city manages its resources in a way to provide for the physiological needs of its residents - nature, air, water, shelter, heating, sleep, and clothing.

Safety needs - personal space, personal security, health, and property - are provided in the personal spaces, group and family spaces, and public spaces across the city.

Finally, the city helps its residents fulfill their higher needs of love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization, by relieving them from the time, efforts, and anxiety for providing for their survival.

All residents have full access to the resources and services to cover their needs.
They are guaranteed to not need to enter survival mode.
This will encourage them to seek higher standard of living and greater purpose.

### Shelter

Shelter is provided by residential buildings in the personal spaces.
Every resident has at least 50 square meters of personal space designed according to their preferences.
The personal space consists of at least a bedroom, a toilet and bathroom, and a living room.
The resident may wish to share a space with a partner, friends, or family.

### Air

Air-conditioning with purification systems is available in all spaces in the city.
Depending on the preferences of the residents, all spaces may have close access to a park and use fresh air from nature.

### Heating

Air-conditioning with cooling and heating systems is available in all spaces in the city.

### Food

The city provides a personalized diet to every individual resident based on their nutrition and taste needs and preferences.

### Healthcare

The city provides healthy environment to all residents including provision for all physiological needs, healthy food, healthy sleep.
All spaces are designed to minimize incidents, including industrial and traffic-related risks.
There is a clear focus on prevention of health problems.
This is the basis for a healthier population.

In addition, all residents have access to high-quality medical equipment and expertise.

### Communication

All residents have access to video and audio communication, the internet, AI assistance.
