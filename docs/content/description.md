# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

The city is governed by automated rules.
The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.
The citizens do not vote but they influence the administration and development of their city through their preferrences.
The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

The city operates within a state. It can isolate its residents from state corruption to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. Resolution of conflicts is delegated to the state.
