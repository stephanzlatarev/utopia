# City Description

Utopia cities are run on automation.

## Governance

In order to ensure that the city reflects the needs and preferences of its residents without possibility for corruption of a ruling elite, governance powers are segregated between three aspects.

### City administration

The city is governed by automated rules that are provided with the blueprint. In the early stages of the implementation of an Utopia city, e.g. Class U1, people will be heavily involved in supervising and carrying out administrative tasks of governance over the city. They may find ways to exploit weaknesses of the blueprint to concentrate power and act in corrupt ways until the developers of the blueprint identify and mitigate those weaknesses. In later stages, Class U5, when city administration is fully automated the possibilities for corruption within the city will be fully removed.

Citizens do not vote on policies, laws and rules. However, they can influence the administration and development of their city in a few ways:
- through their preferences - This mechanism is encoded in the blueprint of the city. As part of the automation, the city administration will collect information about preferences by the residents, through monitoring of usage of services and direct feedback, and will activate the configurations and automations of the blueprint that best reflect the preferences of the residents.
- through direct feedback - The city keeps its blueprint and current state readily available to all its residents, similar to how the public transport in modern sity shows the lines and schedules in realtime. Residents can look into the details of how the city operates in any aspect and any level they want through personal smart devices, public interactive screens, or even AI guide tour. This system doubles as a portal to raise incidents, issues, ideas for improvements - all automatically directed to the developers of the blueprint.
- through civil work - Although the city is fully automated and does not rely on human labor, residents are encouraged to put their mind, energy, and creativity in help of the community. They can work alongside the automation. In lower class cities, they could perform non-automated tasks, train the automation, or supervise it. In higher class cities, they can develop and practice their skills lead by the AI of the automation.
- through blueprint development - Residents may be interested in becoming developers of the blueprint. Then, they will influence all Utopia cities, not just theirs.

The rationale behind this design choice is that people are by nature apolitical and suseptive to corruption. Thus, we offer them an environment where they don't have to actively engage in politics and they cannot assert political power among each other. The environment is similar to a restaurant franchise where people don't get to vote over the recipes and ingredients the chefs use but have freedom over what food they receive by choosing which restaurant they go to and what they order from the menu.

### Blueprint development

The blueprint of the automation is developed and maintained as open source. Collectively, the developers of the blueprint have no stake in any individual Utopia city. The open source nature of the blueprint allows for parallel variants which removes the possibility for the developers to encode concentrated power of an elite group in all Utopia cities.
This guarantees the founding principle of Utopia that no person or group of people have power over the city and its residents.

This design choice is inspired by the Linux operating system for computers. The developers of Linux distributions encode automation rules for how the computer resources are used for certain tasks. Yet, they don't have any control over the computers on which I install the Linux OS.

### State rule

### Public Safety and Conflict Resolution

The blueprint acknowledges "security" as a fundamental basic need (Principle 02). In an environment where "no person controls the city" (Principle 01), public safety and conflict resolution are managed through a phased approach, evolving with the city's automation maturity.

*   **Class U1-U3: Hybrid Model with State Liaison**
    *   **Immediate Safety & Serious Crime:** For incidents requiring immediate physical intervention or involving serious criminal offenses (as defined by the overarching state), the City Administration acts as an automated liaison and dispatch system. Sensor data, resident reports (via direct feedback portals), and AI analysis will trigger alerts to the appropriate state emergency services (e.g., state police, fire, medical teams). Utopia residents and property will be protected under state law, with the city facilitating rapid response and information sharing to state authorities.
    *   **Internal Disputes & Minor Infractions:** For minor civil disputes or infractions of city rules (e.g., noise complaints, minor resource misuse), automated mediation systems will be deployed. These systems will leverage resident feedback, usage patterns, and predefined blueprint rules to offer resolution pathways. Human administrators (in U1-U3) will supervise these automated processes, acting as mediators or adjudicators only when automation fails to resolve the conflict and with explicit oversight by the blueprint developers to prevent bias or power concentration.
    *   **Data Privacy:** All monitoring and data collection for public safety purposes will adhere to strict, transparent privacy protocols defined in the blueprint, ensuring data anonymization where possible and access only for explicitly defined safety and resolution functions.

*   **Class U5: Advanced Automated Intervention**
    *   **Proactive Monitoring & Prevention:** The city's automation will proactively monitor environmental and social indicators for potential conflicts or safety risks, employing advanced AI to identify patterns and anomalies that could lead to incidents. This includes predictive maintenance to prevent structural failures, traffic flow optimization to reduce accidents, and resource distribution to prevent scarcity-driven disputes.
    *   **Automated Conflict Resolution:** The automation will take a more direct role in resolving disputes, utilizing sophisticated algorithms for impartial evidence gathering, rule interpretation, and proposing solutions based on the collective preferences and principles of the city. Human supervision will transition from active adjudication to oversight and intervention only in highly complex or unprecedented cases, focusing on training the AI.
    *   **Reduced State Dependency:** Reliance on external state services for most internal public safety and conflict resolution matters will significantly decrease, with state intervention limited to the most severe or inter-city incidents.

*   **Class U6: Fully Automated Justice & Self-Sufficiency**
    *   **Autonomous Justice System:** The city will possess a fully autonomous, AI-driven justice system capable of impartial dispute resolution and enforcement of city rules without human bias. This includes advanced forensic AI, automated evidence collection, and adaptive consequence management that aims for restorative justice and system optimization rather than punitive measures.
    *   **Integrated Security:** Physical and digital security will be fully integrated and automated, leveraging advanced robotics, pervasive sensor networks, and adaptive algorithms to ensure continuous safety and immediate, non-human intervention for threats.
    *   **Independence from State Law:** As the city functions outside of any state, its internal justice system will be the sole authority for all internal matters, aligning completely with Principle 01. External state laws will no longer apply within Utopia, except for agreements related to inter-city or international travel and trade.

This framework ensures a clear path for "security" to be a guaranteed basic need, evolving responsibly towards full automation while bridging the gap with existing state legal frameworks during early development.

Until the automation advances sufficiently, the city operates within a state.
The benefit is that the state laws and policies will cover the dynamics that the blueprint and its automation is not ready for. Resolution of disputes and conflicts is delegated to the state.

The downside is that the city can isolate its residents from state corruption only to the extent that it guarantees all basic needs and the living atandard. The most mature future stages of Utopia cities, Class 6, will have sufficiently advanced automation to handle nuanced resolution of disputes and conflicts fairly and without human bias.

## Housing

To fulfill the principle of guaranteed shelter, Utopia implements a Modular and Adaptable Residential System (MARS). This system is designed to provide housing that dynamically meets the varied and changing needs of its residents.

### Key Features:
*   **Modularity:** Residential buildings are constructed from standardized, prefabricated modules (e.g., living space modules, kitchen modules, accessible bathroom modules).
*   **Adaptability:** Based on declared resident preferences and needs (such as family growth, aging, or disability), the automation system can reconfigure, add, or remove modules from a residential unit. This ensures a resident's home evolves with their life-cycle.
*   **Efficiency:** The use of standardized modules allows for automated mass production, high energy efficiency standards, and simplified robotic maintenance. It also creates a circular economy where modules from downsized or vacated units are refurbished and redeployed, minimizing waste.
*   **Allocation:** Initial housing allocation and subsequent modifications are managed by the city's core automation, based on resident profiles and needs assessment, ensuring equitable and appropriate distribution of living space.
