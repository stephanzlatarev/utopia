# Roadmap

This roadmap shows the stages through which the blueprint for Utopia cities will evolve as the employed technologies advance over time.
It may also be used to guide the implementation phases of newly found Utopia cities.

## Class U1

The priciple of Basic needs is fully met.
The city operates as a commercial all-inclusive resort. Automation is basic. Most services use human labor. Administration is done by a hosting company. The hosting company charges the residents with an annual flat fee that covers its expenses for their basic needs and the living standard services.
Founding of new cities is funded by commercial entities.

## Class U2

The city operates as a commercial all-inclusive resort. Automation covers most, but not all, basic needs of the residents. Human labor is required for supervision of the automation and for providing for some basic needs and for all living standard services.
The hosting company still charges the residents with an annual flat fee, but the value of the services to the residents is multiple times higher than the fee.

## Class U3

The administration of the city is automated. It still uses human labor for supervision and provision of services.

## Class U5

The city is fully automated. It doesn't require any human labor. The city guarantees all basic needs of its residents as well as high standard of living.
On top of that, the city doesn't rely on imports from foreign entities.
Residents are not charged any fees.
Founding of new cities is funded by the existing network of Utopia cities on demand by residents.

## Class U6

The city is fully automated. It is self-sufficient and doesn't require any human labor or imports from foreign entities. The city guarantees all basic needs of its residents as well as high standard of living.
On top of that, the city functions outside of any state.

## Class U7

The priciple of Freedom is fully met.
The automation is so advanced that it can operate on any scale down to population of 1 and still provide for the basic needs and living standard without dependencies to human labor or imports.
Founding of new cities doesn't require significant funding and is available to all individuals.
