# Roadmap

This roadmap shows the stages through which the blueprint for Utopia cities will evolve as the employed technologies advance over time.
It may also be used to guide the implementation phases of newly found Utopia cities.

> The following classification starts from cities that start with the mission to fulfill all founding principles of Utopia cities, and each subsequent class fully meets one more principle.
The fulfillment of principles is rated as follows:
★☆☆☆☆ - Doesn't meet the principle but aspires to.
★★☆☆☆ - Partially fulfills the principle.
★★★☆☆ - Fully meets the principle even if improvements may be desired.
★★★★☆ - Exceed the expectations for the principle and continuously improves.
★★★★★ - Full and sustained fulfillment of the principle.

### Transitional Governance and Economic Model

To address the inherent conflict of interest in a for-profit entity building a non-profit society, the initial administration of Class U1-U4 cities will not be managed by a traditional "hosting company." Instead, it will be operated by a **Utopia Development Trust**.

*   **Mission-Driven Charter:** The Trust is a legally distinct entity, similar to a B Corporation or a steward-owned company. Its founding charter and legal structure irrevocably bind it to the Utopian principles. The Trust's primary, legally-enforceable mandate is to achieve the technological and social milestones of Class U5.
*   **Reinvestment Obligation:** All revenue generated from resident fees in Class U1-U4 cities is treated as surplus. After covering operational costs, this surplus *must* be reinvested into research, development, and implementation of the automation systems required to advance to the next Class.
*   **Path to Dissolution:** Upon reaching the criteria for Class U5 (full automation, no fees required), the Trust's charter dictates that it must transfer all administrative control to the city's automated governance system and dissolve its own authority over the city. This ensures a planned transition of power from the human-led transitional body to the fair and automated final system.
