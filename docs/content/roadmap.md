# Roadmap

This roadmap shows the stages through which the blueprint for Utopia cities will evolve as the employed technologies advance over time.
It may also be used to guide the implementation phases of newly found Utopia cities.

## Class U1

The city operates as a commercial all-inclusive resourt. Automation is basic. Most services use human labor. Administration is done by a hosting company. The hosting company charges the residents with an annual flat fee that covers its expenses for their basic needs and the living standard services.

## Class U2

The city operates as a commercial all-inclusive resourt. Automation covers most, but not all, basic needs of the residents. Human labor is required for supervision of the automation and for providing for some basic needs and for all living standard services.
The hosting company still charges the residents with an annual flat fee, but the value of the services to the residents is multiple times higher than the fee.

## Class U3

The administration of the city is automated. It still uses human labor for supervision and provision of services.

## Class U5

The city is fully automated. It doesn't require any human labor. The city guarantees all basic needs of its residents as well as high standard of living.
On top of that, the city doesn't rely on imports from foreign entities.

## Class U6

The city is fully automated. It is self-sufficient and doesn't require any human labor or imports from foreign entities. The city guarantees all basic needs of its residents as well as high standard of living.
On top of that, the city functions outside of any state.
